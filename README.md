Backend development is also known as server-side development. It refers to the development of the behind-the-scenes logic that powers web applications. Back-end development involves everything that exists in the server. This includes everything from data modeling and storage to security concerns1.

<p>
Back-end developers focus on data, creating the structure and implementing the back-end logic of a website by using back-end programming languages. They also create the APIs (or other communication system) that allow front-end developers to access the server-side data and display it on the front end for the user1.

Some of the tools and programming languages that back-end developers use include Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), Ruby, C#, different types of databases, frameworks, web servers and more..
